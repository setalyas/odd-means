# Non-standard means

I challenge anyone reading this to find a good use case for these.

### Ditherer's mean

The ditherer's mean is an extension of the arithmetic-geometric mean, as [defined by Evelyn Lamb](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/the-ditherers-mean/):

> To take the dithererâ€™s mean of n numbers, we want an iterative process that gives us n numbers at each step. So at each step, we replace the smallest number from the previous list of numbers with the geometric mean of the previous numbers and the largest number with the arithmetic mean of the numbers.

### Geothmetic meandian

The geothmetic meandian is for the indecisive people who can't pick between the arithmetic mean, median, and geometric mean -- as [created by Randall Munroe](https://xkcd.com/2435/).
